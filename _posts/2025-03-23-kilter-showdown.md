<p>Join the first-ever Kilterboard competition at Bruut on Friday, March 28th! This epic showdown is for all levels starting at 5b. Climbers will progress through a series of increasingly difficult boulders starting at their desired level. They will advance by successfully completing a boulder. Pushed onward by a live DJ, the action continues until there is only one person standing.</p>
